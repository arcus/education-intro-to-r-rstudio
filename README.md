## Overview

This module provides learners with an approachable introduction to the R language and the RStudio IDE, including hands-on practice appropriate for someone who has never used R or RStudio.

**Estimated time to completion**: 1 hour

**Pre-requisites**: It is helpful if learners have used data in a tabular (table-shaped) format, with rows and columns.  Examples of this kind of data include comma separated values files (.csv) and spreadsheets (for example, Microsoft Excel).  Learners do *not* need to have access to R or RStudio on their own computers.  

**Format**: This module uses text, still images, hands-on activities, and video.  Audio is optional.

**Learning Objectives**:  After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

* Describe what R is and what RStudio is
* Understand what a script is and how using a script can improve research
* Execute given R code within RStudio
* Explain what a data frame is
* Use the Environment tab within RStudio to examine a data frame
