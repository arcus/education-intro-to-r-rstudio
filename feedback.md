# Feedback
*5 minute feedback*

In the beginning, we stated some goals.

**Learning Objectives**:  After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

* Describe what R is and what RStudio is
* Understand what a script is and how using a script can improve research
* Execute given R code within RStudio
* Explain what a data frame is
* Use the Environment tab within RStudio to examine a data frame

We ask you to fill out a brief (5 minutes or less) survey to let us know:

* If we achieved the learning objectives
* If the module difficulty was appropriate
* If we gave you the experience you expected

We gather this information in order to iteratively improve our work.  Thank you in advance for filling out [our brief survey](https://redcap.chop.edu/surveys/?s=KHTXCXJJ93&module_name=%22Intro+to+R+and+RStudio%22)!
