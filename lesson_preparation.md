# Lesson Preparation

*2 minute hands-on*

If you intend to do the hands on activity in this module, we have a bit of preparation for you to do now.

Because it can take a few minutes for the environment to be created, we suggest you click on the link that will start up the activity.

It will open in a new tab or window, and you can simply return here to continue learning, while the environment finishes loading.

Here's the link.  You don't have to do anything except come back here once the link opens in a new tab or window.
