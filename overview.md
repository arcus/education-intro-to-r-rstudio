This module provides learners with an approachable introduction to the R language and the RStudio IDE, including hands-on practice appropriate for someone who has never used R or RStudio.

**Learning Objectives**:  After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

* Describe what R is and what RStudio is
* Understand what a script is and how using a script can improve research
