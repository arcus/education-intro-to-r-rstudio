# RStudio Features

*5 minute hands-on*

We're only going to touch on three of many useful tools here.  When time permits, you may want to explore more.

## Help

Within RStudio, click on the "Help" tab in the lower right pane.  Choose one promising help topic to click on.  It appears as a new tab or window in your browser.

There are two search boxes related to help.  The one on the left, just above the help text, includes the phrase "Find in Topic".  This is for searching within the help article you're looking at currently.

The other search box is in the upper right part of the pane and can be used for searching across all available help.  For example, search for "hist" in this search box.

## History

Within RStudio, click on the "History" tab in the upper right pane.  The commands that have been executed during your current session are listed.

Choose one of the commands by clicking on it, and choose the "To Console" button.  The code should now appear in the console in the lower left pane, ready for you to hit enter and run that command anew.

## Display

Use the "Tools" menu at the top of RStudio, choose "Global Options", then  "Appearance".

Experiment with editor settings (font size and theme), and if you want to try it out, choose "Apply".
