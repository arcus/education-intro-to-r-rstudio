# Starting RStudio

*10 minutes hands-on*

You don't have to have R and RStudio installed on your local computer to learn how to use them.  We've provided a simple environment you can use.  It will probably take a few minutes to load up, especially if it's "cold" (hasn't been used by anyone lately).

If you already clicked on the "launch binder" button as the first activity, you can simply open that tab on your browser.

Didn't click it before?  No worries! Click below and an RStudio environment will open in your browser window.  We suggest using Chrome for this.

While you wait for RStudio to load, come back here and read a bit more.

## While You're Waiting...

Do you wonder where you can install R and RStudio, and how much they'll cost your lab?

These are free, open source software (**FOSS**), and both R and RStudio can be installed in a number of different kinds of systems.

You can run R and RStudio:

* From your local computer (download a Windows, Mac, or linux version of R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download))
* On a cloud service provider like [RStudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud)
* On a server that your research center provides
* On a temporary environment someone prepares for you, like our Pangeo Binder environment

A to-do list for you to consider:

* <input type="checkbox"> Try installing [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) to your computing device.
* <input type="checkbox"> Not ready to commit to downloading R and RStudio yet?  Create a free [RStudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) account!
* <input type="checkbox"> Ask your colleagues who use R and RStudio where they do their work in R, and if there are any steps you need to take to get access (like request access to a server at your lab or workplace)
* <input type="checkbox"> [Cloud Tools for the Unconvinced](https://education.arcus.chop.edu/r-python-cloud/).  This brief article (2 minute read) introduces [RStudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and includes a link to a project you can look at, copy, and learn from.

## Still waiting?

While things are loading, you might see an image like this, and it might stay this way for a few minutes.  Be patient!  If you have a few friends to do this together with, it can help speed things up, since the environment will have been recently used and ready to deploy more quickly.

## Finally Loaded!

Once your environment has loaded, you will be able to see something like the following:

Take a look around.  What do you see?  How would you describe the layout of panes and tabs to another person?  What do you think the different parts do?

Try describing RStudio's appearance out loud to yourself.  This may seem silly but it is another way to consolidate your learning.
