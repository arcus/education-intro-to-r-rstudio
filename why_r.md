# Why Use R and RStudio?

*5 minute read*

Fine, you now know a bit more about R and RStudio, but why does this matter?  You may already know how to conduct statistical data analysis in tools like SPSS, Excel, or other software.  Why, then, learn R?  Is R only for professional data scientists?

R and RStudio are great tools for professional data scientists, but they are also increasingly part of the research tool kit, much like other lab equipment that researchers have to learn to use.  This is because the **reproducibility crisis** of studies that cannot be reproduced or fail to reproduce can be ameliorated in part by the use of scripted data analysis.

R and other free, open source, and scripted (code-based) methods of data analysis are widely considered more reproducible because:

* Anyone can obtain the software needed to use R scripts, with no license cost.
* Operations you perform to data are recorded in a script, which means they are not lost to history in the same way you might forget to precisely record a step you took in, say, Excel.
* Scripted languages can do multiple stages of data analysis in a single tool, such as downloading data, cleaning and reshaping data, performing statistical tests, displaying data visualizations, and more.

There are many reasons why the research community is pivoting to languages like R.  While learning a new technical skill can be time consuming, working with R will pay off in the long run, because it makes it easier for you to re-run your analyses, describe your methods precisely, share your work with colleagues, and meet the requirements of funders and publications when it comes to reproducible research.
